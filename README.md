# web-projects
My Web App Portfolio

This repo contains code written entirely by me, influenced by a variety of online tutorials and examples. The repo will continually increase in complexity and size with the addition of every project. Some of these 'projects' will act as individual components for future, more comprehensive projects, which I'll list here in time.

The main purpose of this repo is to provide insight into the development of my front-end skills and how I have chosen to apply them in my own individual way.
